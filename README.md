## 🌟 Features

- **Neural Symbolic Processing**: Train models to understand and generate symbolic sequences
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time visualization of neural activations and generation process
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to modify and extend for different symbol sets
- **Research Ready**: Perfect for exploring neural-symbolic integration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuro-lingo.git
   cd neuro-lingo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the demo:
   ```bash
   python neurolingo_demo.py
   ```

## 🧠 How It Works

NeuroLingo combines modern deep learning with symbolic AI to create a system that can learn patterns in symbolic sequences and generate new, meaningful sequences. The framework uses LSTM-based sequence modeling with attention mechanisms to process and generate symbolic data.
