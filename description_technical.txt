ðŸ§  **NeuroLingo: A Neural-Symbolic AI Framework**

**Overview**
NeuroLingo is an experimental framework that combines neural networks with symbolic computation, enabling AI systems to learn, generate, and manipulate symbolic glyph sequences through deep learning techniques.

**Technical Details**
- **Architecture**: Implements a sequence-to-sequence model with LSTM-based architecture
- **Training**: Uses teacher forcing with cross-entropy loss on symbolic sequences
- **Generation**: Implements temperature-based sampling for controlled randomness
- **Visualization**: Real-time rendering of network activations and attention patterns

**Key Features**
- Symbolic sequence generation with controllable temperature
- Interactive training visualization
- Extensible architecture for different symbol sets
- Real-time generation and feedback

**Potential Applications**
- AI-assisted symbolic reasoning
- Neural-symbolic integration research
- Novel HCI paradigms
- Creative AI and generative art

**Technical Stack**
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib for visualization
- NumPy for numerical operations

**Getting Started**
```bash
git clone [repo-url]
cd neuro-lingo
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo.py
```

**Research Directions**
- Extending to larger vocabulary sizes
- Incorporating attention mechanisms
- Multi-modal integration (text-to-symbol, symbol-to-text)
- Few-shot learning capabilities
